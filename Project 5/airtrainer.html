<div class="airtrainerbody">THE NIKE AIR TRAINER 1 IS CREDITED FOR BEING THE FIRST CROSS-TRAINING SNEAKER EVER. TENNIS START JOHN MCENROE WAS THE FIRST TO DEBUT THEM ON COURT IN 1987. THIS SHOE, WHICH WAS DESIGNED BY TINKER HATFIELD, PAVED THE WAY FOR MANY FUTURE TRAINING SHOE RELEASES FROM NIKE. THE SHOE IS MADE OF BOTH SUEDE AND LEATHER AND ALSO FEATURES A VELCRO STRAP IN THE MIDDLE. THE AIR TRAINER HAS BEEN RE-RELEASED COUNTLESS TIMES OVER THE YEARS DUE TO ITS POPULARITY.</div>
