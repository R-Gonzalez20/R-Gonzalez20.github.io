<div class="title">BLAZER</div>
<div class="blazerbody">THE BLAZER WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BASKETBALL SHOES RELEASED BY NIKE. IT WAS DEBUTED ON FOOT IN THE NBA IN 1973 BY GEORGE GERVIN, A PLAYER FOR THE SAN ANTONIO SPURS. IT WAS RELEASED IN 3 MODELS: A HIGH, LOW, AND MID TOP BLAZER. THE BLAZER IS RECOGNIZED MAINLY FOR ITS EXTREMELY LARGE NIKE SWOOSH ON ITS SIDE. IT IS MADE OF BOTH CANVAS AND LEATHER. TODAY THE NIKE BLAZERS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR AND HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO MORE OF A SKATE SHOE.</div>
