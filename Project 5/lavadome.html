THIS SHOE WAS NIKEâ€™S FIRST ATTEMPT AT A SNEAKER MADE FOR OUTDOOR WEAR. THE LAVA DOME WAS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF HIKING AND RUNNING. IT IS MADE OF BOTH SUEDE AND LEATHER. WHILE IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE LESS POPULAR SHOES INCLUDED IN THIS COLLECTION, IT PAVED THE WAY FOR MANY OTHER ICONIC NIKE RUNNING SHOES.</div>
