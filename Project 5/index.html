<div class="mainpagebio">SNEAKERS HAVE NEARLY ALWAYS BEEN A STAPLE ITEM IN EVERYONE’S WARDROBE. HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, THEY HAVE EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT. AFTER THE ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER OF MICHAEL JORDAN, THE RISE OF STREETWEAR, AND OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS, SNEAKERS HAVE BECOME A COLLECTIBLE ITEM. COLLECTORS WORLDWIDE, OFTEN KNOWN AS “SNEAKERHEADS,” SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS AND MONEY TO ACQUIRE THE RAREST SNEAKERS ON THE MARKET. IT HAS BECOME A HOBBY AND A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. WHILE THERE ARE MANY ICONIC SNEAKER BRANDS, NONE STAND OUT AMONGST THE REST MORE THAN NIKE. THIS VIRTUAL COLLECTION HIGHLIGHTS 20 OF NIKE’S MOST ICONIC SNEAKERS EVER RELEASED.
